This Android Library Project was created by following these steps:

* Checked out zxing-android from SVN (http://zxing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ r2338)
* Overlayed the source from zxing-core
* Set to library project and refactored switch statements to if-else
* Changed intent names to avoid conflict with ZXing app
* Removed two lines from AndroidManifest.xml to avoid shortcuts being created
* Commented out call to showHelpOnFirstLaunch
