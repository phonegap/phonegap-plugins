# AppLinker plugin for PhoneGap #

By Ulf Hartelius, Nindev AB

## About the plugin ##
This app simply either launches Google Play and goes to the selected app OR, if the selected app is already installed, launches the app.
Good for promoting other apps or for easy connection between your apps.

Tested on the following OS version: 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 4.0.3

## Adding the plugin to your project ##
1. Move applinker.js to your project's www folder and reference it in your html file(s).
2. Add the AppLinker.java inside a package se.nindev.applinker

## Using the plugin ##
There's only a single method: linkApp(packageName, success, fail).
In your js code, call new AppLinker().linkApp (or have an AppLinker object created earlier) with the arguments you want. Specifically, the packageName parameter is the full package name of the app you want to link to (e.g. se.lineducation.skolkoll). That's it.
Note that the package name is publicly available, so you can link to apps that you haven't created. Easiest way of finding a package name is to go to it on Google Play and see the id in the url.
