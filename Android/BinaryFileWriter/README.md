# BinaryFileWriter plugin for Android/Phonegap
Antonio Hern√°ndez <ahernandez@emergya.com>

## Using the plugin

* Add java code to your project's build source

* Add javascript code to your project's www directory

* Include the javascript in your HTML

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="binaryfilewriter.js"></script>
```

* Register the plugin in the plugins.xml file

```xml
<plugin name="BinaryFileWriter" value="com.phonegap.plugins.binaryfilewriter.BinaryFileWriter" />
```

* The plugin extends PhoneGap FileWriter object with FileWriter.writeBinaryArray() method, so you can use it
the same way you use the FileWriter.write() method.

```javascript
var data = /* Some kind of typed array like Uint8Array ... */;

function win(writer) {

    writer.onwrite = function(evt) {
        console.log("write success");
    };

    writer.writeBinaryArray(data);
};

var fail = function(evt) {
    console.log(error.code);
};

entry.createWriter(win, fail);
```
